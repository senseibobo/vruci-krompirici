# Vruci Krompirici
This is the first game I made with a random. It was for the M3 Game Jam in 2022.<br>
This is probably one of my most fun and polished games, and although it's pretty nice and cute, it's not very feature-rich.<br>
You are a potato and you play against a friend (or yourself) and throw another hot potato at each other to try to fry the other one.<br>
The game can get pretty intense later on, because it speeds up and becomes more punishing.<br>
It's also on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bogdanjocic.vrucikrompirici)<br>
Features:
- Heat meter
- 2 players
- 3 lives
- Special last round if both players have 1 life
- 3 powerups that are used strategically throughout the game
- Mobile port
- Random "lights out" event (this isn't very useful or game-changing but it looks cool)
